## Description

This is my first React app. Found a great [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ZUc7zH8BE) that explains a lot more of the info finally.
Used [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pKjULHzs0s) and the React-Bootstrap docs to implement Bootstrap into it as well.
This is a hell of a lot of fun :D :D
